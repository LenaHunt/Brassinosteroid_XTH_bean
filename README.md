# Brassinosteroid_XTH_bean
Data and R scripts for the manuscript **"Brassinosteroid treatment reveals the importance of xyloglucan transglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) genes in growth habit determination of twining common bean vines"**
<br>

_(Note that the three treatments are abreviated as BL for brassinolide-treated (a brassinosteroid), BZ for brassinazole treated (a brassinosteroid inhibitor), and ET for the ethanol-only "mock" treatment.)_
<br>
<br>


R codes used to visualize data relating morphology can be douns in the main folder.
<br>

This includes:
<br>
<br>
-internode elongation, 

-G-fiber length and width, 

-xyloglucan presence detected in the G-layer via LM15
<br>
<br>


<br>

The datasets for each of these codes can be found in **Data Files**.
<br>
<br>

R codes used to visualize RNA sequencing data results are found in the **RNAseq Data** folder. 
<br>

This includes:
<br>

-Venn Diagrams of DEG

-GO term analysis

-Volcano plots

-Heatmap of XTH genes

<br>

The .BAM files are available for download (website) but the necessary files generated in R so recreate the figures can be found in **Data Files** (nested under RNAseq Data).
<br>

At minimum, you will need gene_counts and metadata to run these codes.
