# Brassinosteroid_XTH_bean
Data and R scripts for: Brassinosteroid treatment reveals the importance of xyloglucan transglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) genes in growth habit determination of twining common bean vines.

Note that the three treatments are abreviated as BL for brassinolide-treated (a brassinosteroid), BZ for brassinazole treated (a brassinosteroid inhibitor), and ET for the ethanol-only "mock" treatment (lanolin with the equivalent amount of ethanol used to dissove brassinolide and brassinazole).
