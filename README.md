# Brassinosteroid_XTH_bean
Data and R scripts for: Brassinosteroid treatment reveals the importance of xyloglucan transglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) genes in growth habit determination of twining common bean vines.

R codes used to visualize data relating to internode elongation, G-fiber length and width, and xyloglucan presence detected in the G-layer via LM15 are found in this main folder. The datasets for each of these codes can be found in *Data Files*.
R codes used to visualize RNA sequencing data results are found in the *RNAseq Data* folder. The .BAM files are available for download (website) but the necessary files generated in R so recreate the figures can be found in *Data Files*.

Note that the three treatments are abreviated as BL for brassinolide-treated (a brassinosteroid), BZ for brassinazole treated (a brassinosteroid inhibitor), and ET for the ethanol-only "mock" treatment (lanolin with the equivalent amount of ethanol used to dissove brassinolide and brassinazole). 

The R codes used to generate visuals are listed below with the Figure from the paper.
